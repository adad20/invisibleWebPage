    	<p onmouseover="unfade(this)" onmouseout="fade(this)" >
    		Hey everyone, I am currently in my second year of engineering pursuing my degree with electrical and electronics engineering.
    		<br>
    		Inspite of being electrical engineer I have keen interest in programming and building new things. When I was in my first year of engineering I came in contact with programming for the fist time.<br>
    		From then I always try to teach myself new and new things. I always get surprised seeing the miracles of programming and the beauty of it. <br>
    		During the starting of my journey I first learned C++ and the slowly came into contact with web development. I must say that this contact changed my life. I feeling of developing and seeing the change is just amazing.<br>

    	<p onmouseover="unfade(this)" onmouseout="fade(this)">
    		Since I came in contact with the web development I started with html, css, javaScript, nodejs and various other technologies.
    		<br>
    		Not ony web development fascinates me but computer science fascinates me. I have good knowledge of various programming language such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and PHP. I also have interest in competitive programming and try to participate in various contests held online.<br>
